FLOWER RECOGNITION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK(CNN)  -  Model Evolution :  In real world scenarios Evaluating the model's effectiveness is very crucial to ensure that it can accurately classify flowers.
Using the validation data, we have integrated a method for continuous evaluation .
During Each evaluation our model computes various metrics, including loss and accuracy . Loss measures how well our model is performing its tasks while accurancy gives us a sense that how often it indentifies the flowers.
In conclusion, the flower recognition project has successfully developed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately identifying different species of flowers from images.
The model achieved 80%  accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in flower classification tasks.
Through comprehensive data preprocessing, model construction, and training, we have established a robust framework for automated flower recognition.
